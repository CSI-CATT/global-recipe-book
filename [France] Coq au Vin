🥘 Description
Coq au Vin is a classic French dish that translates to “rooster in wine.” Traditionally made using an old rooster slowly braised in red wine with mushrooms, onions, garlic, bacon, and herbs, this dish represents the heart of French country cooking — turning simple ingredients into a rich, flavorful masterpiece.
Over time, it has become a beloved comfort food across France and the world, usually served with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or buttered noodles.

🍗 Ingredients

1.Chicken (bone-in pieces or whole cut into parts)	1.2 kg	Traditionally rooster, but chicken works perfectly
2.Red wine (Burgundy or Pinot Noir)	2 cups	Deep red wine adds richness

7.Garlic	3–4 cloves	Minced
8.Carrot	1	Chopped
9.Celery stalk	1	Chopped
10.Tomato paste	1 tbsp	For depth of flavor
11.Fresh thyme	2–3 sprigs	Optional: add parsley for garnish
12.Bay leaf	1	For aroma
13.Olive oil	2 tbsp	For sautéing
14.All-purpose flour	1 tbsp	Helps thicken sauce

👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Preparation
1.Marinate the Chicken (optional but traditional):
Combine chicken pieces with red wine, chopped carrots, celery, garlic, and herbs.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight for best flavor.
Drain and pat the chicken dry before cooking. Keep the marinade aside.
2.Render Bacon and Brown the Chicken:
In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove and set aside.
In the same fat, sear the chicken pieces until golden brown on all sides.
Remove chicken and set aside.
3.Sauté Vegetables:
In the remaining fat, sauté pearl onions, mushrooms, and carrots until lightly golden.
Add garlic and tomato paste; cook for 1–2 minutes.
4.Deglaze and Combine:
Sprinkle flour and stir to coat.
Slowly pour in red wine (from the marinade or fresh) while stirring, scraping up brown bits from the bottom.
Add chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf, and cooked bacon.
5.Braise:
Return chicken pieces to the pot.
Cover and simmer on low heat for 1.5 hours, or until the chicken becomes tender and the sauce thickens.
(Alternatively, bake in the oven at 180°C / 350°F for about 1 hour.)

Final Touch:

Remove herbs and bay leaf.
Taste and adjust seasoning.
Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.

🍽️ Serving Suggestions
Serve hot with buttered mashed potatoes, crusty baguette, or egg noodles.
Pair with a glass of the same red wine used for cooking for an authentic French dining experience.

💡 Tips & Variations

Vegetarian Twist: Substitute chicken with mushrooms and tofu; use vegetable broth instead.

Make Ahead: Tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop overnight.
