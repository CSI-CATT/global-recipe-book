🍲 Description

Miso Soup is a traditional Japanese soup made from a base of dashi (broth) mixed with miso paste, and typically includes tofu cubes, wakame seaweed, and green onions.
It’s known for its comforting, umami-rich flavor and nutritional value — high in protein, vitamins, and probiotics.
The soup is deeply rooted in Japanese culture and is often served as a side dish to rice and fish-based meals.

🧂 Ingredients

Dashi (traditional broth made from kombu & bonito flakes)	2 cups	
Miso paste (white or red)	2 tablespoons	
Tofu (silken or firm)	½ cup
Wakame seaweed (dried)	1 tablespoon	
Green onions	1–2 stalks	Finely chopped, for garnish

👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Preparation :

1. Prepare the Dashi:
Heat 2 cups of water in a pot.
Add kombu (dried kelp) and bring close to a boil.
Remove kombu just before the water boils.
Add bonito flakes, simmer for a minute, and strain to make clear dashi.
(You can use instant dashi granules for a quicker version.)

2.Add Main Ingredients:
Add cubed tofu and rehydrated wakame to the hot dashi broth.
Let it simmer gently for 2–3 minutes.

3.Add Miso Paste (Carefully):
Turn off the heat before adding miso.
In a small bowl, take a ladleful of the hot broth and dissolve the miso paste completely.
Add the dissolved miso back into the pot.
Do not boil after adding miso — this preserves flavor and nutrients.

4.Garnish and Serve:
Sprinkle chopped green onions on top.
Serve immediately while warm.

💡 Tips & Variations
You can adjust the saltiness by using more or less miso paste.
Add ingredients like mushrooms, daikon radish, spinach, or clams for extra flavor.
For vegan/vegetarian versions, use kombu-based dashi instead of bonito flakes.

Store miso soup in the fridge for 1–2 days, but reheat gently without boiling.
